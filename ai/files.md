# Project Files

## JavaScript Files — scraper/

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scraper/index.js` | Main scraper - full workflow: validate company → scrape → transform → upsert → delete stale → generate docs/jobs.md |
| `scraper/company.js` | Validates company via ANAF + CUIScan + Peviitor APIs, checks if company is active/inactive |
| `scraper/company-data.js` | Multi-source company data module - ANAF + CUIScan (company details) + CUIFirma (search). Exports `getCompanyFromANAF`, `getCompanyFromANAFWithFallback`, `searchCompany` |
| `scraper/company-data-cli.js` | CLI entry point for company-data.js (thin wrapper) |
| `scraper/api.js` | Peviitor API operations module - exports querySOLR, deleteJobByUrl, upsertJobs + standalone verify/extract/company commands |
| `scraper/validate-jobs.js` | **Generic deep validator (manual use).** Full GET requests, parses page body for "no longer available" keywords. Works with any CIF, single URL, or file. Slower but catches soft-404s. Not used by CI. |
| `scraper/job-validator.js` | Shared validation primitives - exports validateByHead(url), validateByContent(url, opts), DEFAULT_EXPIRED_KEYWORDS. Used by both `validate-jobs.js` and `tests/validate-nttdata-jobs.js`. |
| `scraper/markdown-generator.js` | Generates docs/jobs.md - exports generateJobsMarkdown(companyData, jobs) |

## Config — scraper/config/

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scraper/config/company.json` | **Single source of truth for company identity.** All scraper code, CI workflows, and the static HTML read from this file. To derive a scraper for a different company, this is the primary file to edit. |
| `scraper/config/company.js` | ESM wrapper that imports and exposes `scraper/config/company.json` to Node code |

## Test Files — tests/

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tests/package.json` | Jest config for test suite - experimental VM modules, test scripts (unit/integration/e2e/consistency) |
| `tests/company.json` | Mock company data used in unit tests |
| `tests/validate-nttdata-jobs.js` | **NTT DATA-specific fast validator (used by CI).** HEAD requests only, hardcoded NTT DATA CIF. Called nightly by `automation-testing.yml`. Supports `--dry-run` and `--delete`. |
| `tests/unit/index.test.js` | Unit tests for index.js - parseApiJobs, mapToJobModel, transformJobsForSOLR |
| `tests/unit/company.test.js` | Unit tests for company.js - getCompanyBrand, validateAndGetCompany, fallback caching |
| `tests/unit/api.test.js` | Unit tests for api.js - query, upsert, delete, HTTP error handling |
| `tests/unit/company-data.test.js` | Unit tests for company-data.js - search, company retrieval, CUIScan/CUIFirma fallback |
| `tests/unit/job-validator.test.js` | Unit tests for job-validator.js - validateByHead, validateByContent |
| `tests/unit/markdown-generator.test.js` | Unit tests for markdown-generator.js |
| `tests/integration/workflow.test.js` | Integration tests - ANAF live API, Peviitor API |
| `tests/e2e/scraper.test.js` | E2E tests - full pipeline with real NTT DATA career API, ANAF, and Peviitor API |
| `tests/consistency/public.test.js` | Verifies repository is public on GitHub |
| `tests/consistency/repo.test.js` | Verifies default branch, GitHub Pages, workflow files |
| `tests/consistency/topics.test.js` | Verifies repository has required topics: job-seeker-ro-spider, peviitor-ro |
| `tests/consistency/workflow-naming.test.js` | Validates workflow file naming conventions |

## Markdown Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Project documentation - workflow, technologies, API endpoints, how to update models |
| `job-model.md` | Job schema definition (Peviitor Core) - fields, types, validation rules |
| `company-model.md` | Company schema definition (Peviitor Core) - fields, types, validation rules |
| `files.md` | This file - documents role of each project file |
| `AGENTS.md` | Rules for AI agents working on this project |
| `AI-DERIVATION-GUIDE.md` | **Comprehensive playbook for AI agents deriving a new scraper from this template.** Step-by-step + every known pitfall. |
| `BRANCH.md` | Branch strategy and naming conventions |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history and notable changes |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution guidelines |
| `ISSUES.md` | Issue tracking conventions |
| `PUBLIC.md` | Notes on public visibility and data policies |
| `ROBOTS.md` | robots.txt analysis and scraping policy for NTT DATA Careers |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy and vulnerability reporting |
| `TOPICS.md` | Repository topics documentation |
| `UPDATE-REPO-ABOUT.md` | Instructions for updating repo description/about |
| `VERIFY.md` | Step-by-step verification checklist after changes |

## Configuration Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `package.json` | Node.js project config - dependencies (node-fetch), scripts |
| `package-lock.json` | Locked dependency versions |
| `.npmrc` | npm configuration |
| `.gitignore` | Ignores node_modules/, tmp/, .env.local |
| `.env.local` | Local environment variables - NOT committed |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS` | Code ownership rules for PR reviews |
| `.github/workflows/job-seeker-ro-spider.yml` | Daily scraping workflow (6 AM UTC) |
| `.github/workflows/automation-testing.yml` | Automated tests on every push/PR |

## Data Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tmp/company.json` | **Per-run scratch cache (gitignored).** Survives between CI runs so the scraper does not hit demoANAF on every scrape. Refreshed when older than 7 days. |
| `company.json` (root) | **Committed cache.** Refreshed every 7 days. If ANAF is unreachable AND cache is stale, falls back to stale cache rather than failing. |
| `docs/company.json` | Static copy of `scraper/config/company.json` regenerated on each scrape. Served by GitHub Pages so the live page can read company identity without hardcoding it in HTML. |
| `docs/jobs.md` | Scraped jobs in markdown format - company info + all current jobs (generated by CI after each scrape) |

## Notes

- All `.md` schema files (job-model.md, company-model.md) are dynamic — check peviitor_core README.md for updates
- `tmp/` directory holds runtime artifacts (company.json, jobs.json) — not committed
- Full workflow: validate company (ANAF+CUIScan+CUIFirma+Peviitor) → scrape NTT DATA → transform → upsert → generate docs/jobs.md
