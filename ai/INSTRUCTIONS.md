# Instructions

## Project Purpose

This scraper extracts job listings from EPAM Careers Romania API and imports them to peviitor.ro.

Target: https://careers.epam.com

## Model Schemas

The job and company models are defined in:
- `job-model.md` - Job model schema
- `company-model.md` - Company model schema

## Important

These models are **dynamic** and can change over time. They are based on the official Peviitor Core schemas which may be updated.

## How to Keep Models Updated

When working on this scraper:

1. **Check for updates** in the Peviitor Core repository:
   - Repository: https://github.com/peviitor-ro/peviitor_core
   - Main file: README.md (contains Job and Company model schemas)

2. **When to update**:
   - Before starting new development work
   - If field requirements or validations have changed
   - If new fields have been added

3. **How to update**:
   - Fetch the latest README.md from peviitor_core main branch
   - Compare with current job-model.md and company-model.md
   - Update local files if there are differences
   - Update index.js mapping logic if field requirements changed

## Technologies

- **Node.js & JavaScript** - For scraping and data extraction
- **Peviitor API** - For data storage and retrieval (api.peviitor.ro)
- **Claude Code** - For development

## Workflow Steps

1. **Start with brand** - We know the brand ("EPAM")
2. **Search in DemoANAF** - Find company by brand, get CIF from search results
3. **Get company details from ANAF** - Using CIF, fetch full company data from ANAF
4. **Validate with Peviitor** - Verify company exists in Peviitor, get group/brand info
5. **Check existing jobs** - Query Peviitor API by CIF to see what jobs already exist
6. **Check company status** - If ANAF status = "inactive" → DELETE existing jobs and STOP
7. **Save company.json** - Save all ANAF + Peviitor data for backup
8. **Scrape new jobs** - Extract jobs from EPAM Careers API (Romania)
9. **Transform for API** - Validate and fix job data:
   - location: Only Romanian cities allowed
   - tags: lowercase, no diacritics
   - company: uppercase
10. **Upsert to API** - Import/update jobs via Peviitor API
11. **Verify URLs** - Check existing job URLs still work, delete 404s

## Running the Scraper

```bash
# Run the full scraper workflow (single command)
node scraper/index.js
```

> **Important**: Scraper does NOT delete jobs from other sources (ANOFM, etc). It only upserts EPAM Careers jobs. Existing jobs are preserved.

## Full Workflow (automatic)

When running `node scraper/index.js`, the following steps happen automatically:

1. **Check existing jobs count** - Query Peviitor API by CIF (read-only)
2. **Validate company via ANAF** - Check company exists and is active
3. **Scrape jobs** - Extract jobs from EPAM Careers API (Romania only)
4. **Transform for API** - Fix locations (only Romanian cities), normalize fields
5. **Upsert to API** - Add/update jobs (API handles duplicates by URL)
6. **Delete stale jobs** - Remove jobs in API but no longer on the website
7. **Show Summary** - Log job counts

## API Endpoints

- **DemoANAF Search**: `https://demoanaf.ro/api/search?q=BRAND` - Search companies by name/brand
- **DemoANAF Company**: `https://demoanaf.ro/api/company/:cui` - Get company details by CIF
- **CUIScan**: `https://cuiscan.ro/api.php?action=company&cui=CIF` - Company details fallback
- **CUIFirma Search**: `https://cuifirma.ro/api/search?q=BRAND` - Search fallback
- **Peviitor API**: `https://api.peviitor.ro/v1/` — all job and company operations go through this API
- **EPAM Careers API**: `https://careers.epam.com/api/jobs/v2/search/careers-i18n` — GET with query params (country, page, size)

## Rate Limiting & Politeness

The scraper is intentionally slow to be a good citizen:

| Setting | Value | Where |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Request timeout | 10000 ms | `scraper/company-data.js` — `TIMEOUT_MS` constant |
| ANAF fallback | 1 attempt ANAF → CUIScan | `scraper/company-data.js` — no retries, just fallback |
| Concurrency | 1 (sequential) | No `Promise.all` for paginated fetches |
| User-Agent | `job_seeker_ro_spider` | Identifies the scraper in server logs |
| Page delay | 1000 ms between pages | `scraper/index.js` — `sleep(1000)` |

Derived scrapers should keep these defaults unless the target site explicitly permits otherwise.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | Used by consistency tests — format: `owner/repo` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub API token for consistency tests |

`dotenv` loads `.env.local` automatically at startup — set variables there for local runs. Never commit `.env.local`.

## Standalone Commands

```bash
# Query jobs in SOLR by CIF
node scraper/api.js <CIF>

# Extract existing jobs from SOLR by CIF
node scraper/api.js extract <CIF>

# Query company in SOLR
node scraper/api.js company <search_term>

# Get company details from ANAF/CUIScan by CIF
node scraper/company-data-cli.js <CIF>

# Search companies in ANAF/CUIFirma by brand
node scraper/company-data-cli.js search <brand>

# Validate job URLs from SOLR by CIF (check active/expired)
node scraper/validate-jobs.js <CIF>

# Validate a single job URL
node scraper/validate-jobs.js url <url>

# Delete expired jobs from SOLR by CIF
node scraper/validate-jobs.js <CIF> --delete
```

## Testing

This project requires multiple levels of testing:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual modules (api.js, company.js, company-data.js) in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test API interactions (ANAF, Peviitor, SOLR) in `/tests/integration` folder
3. **E2E Tests** - Test full workflow in `/tests/e2e` folder

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Temporary Files

All temporary/scratch files must be placed in `tmp/` inside the project root (never outside the project). The `tmp/` directory is in `.gitignore` and will not be committed.

## Technical Debt / Completed

- [x] Extract company-data-cli.js to separate module (#2)
- [x] Write Unit Tests for all modules (#3)
- [x] Write Integration Tests in separate folder (#4)
